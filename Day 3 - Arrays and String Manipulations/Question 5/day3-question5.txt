Seetha, a maths teacher explained about Matrix addition, subraction and multiplication in her class.
She assigned different task to her students.
She asked Ankit to add two matrix, Banu to subtract two matrix and Janu to multiply two matrix. Ankit,
Banu and Janu approached Karthick to complete their task.
Karthick is ready to help his friends with single program. So he asked his friends to give a square
matrix only. Help Karthick to write the program.

Input format
Matrix size in first line-N(Only one value)
NxN elements in next rows for first matrix
NxN elements in next rows for second matrix

Refer Sample Input   

Output format
Display result of addition, subtraction and multiplication as shown in sample Output

Code contraints
Only Square Matrix

                                   18 12 6

 Note:
The program will not be evaluated if "Submit Code" is not done atleast once
Extra spaces and new line characters in the program Output will also result in the testcase failing
